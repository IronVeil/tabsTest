# Tabs Test

This is a (poorly-made) test with JS and CSS. It uses various basic JS commands to show and hide elements when the sidebar is clicked. I used CSS grids to render elements correctly and to make a modular design where I can simply place an element into `index.html` and have it render correctly.
